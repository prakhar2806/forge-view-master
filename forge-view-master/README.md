# Polymer 2 App and Autodesk Forge Viewer Starter Kit

This template is a starting point for building polymer apps with Autodesk Forge Platform.


### Setup

##### Prerequisites

First, install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

    npm install -g polymer-cli

Second, install [Bower](https://bower.io/) using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)

    npm install -g bower

##### Clone the project

    git clone https://github.com/cctech-labs/forge-view.git
    cd forge-view
    bower install

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8081` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    polymer serve
